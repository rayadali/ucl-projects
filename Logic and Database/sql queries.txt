1. Give the complete details of all customers living in Washington or Oregon

SELECT 	*
FROM 	customers
WHERE 	state = 'Washington' or state = 'Oregon';

2. How many customers live in each state of which we have a record?

SELECT 	DISTINCT state, count(customerid) as count
FROM 	customers
GROUP 	BY state;

3. What is the surname of the customer who ordered an S4?

SELECT 	customerid, firstname, lastname
FROM 	customers
WHERE 	customerid =
	(SELECT customerid
	FROM orders
	WHERE itemid = 'S4');
	

4. What are the surnames of customers who have ordered items costing more than $28?

SELECT	lastname
FROM	customers
WHERE	customerid IN
	(SELECT customerid
	FROM orders
	WHERE linecost > 28);

5. Which items were ordered by each customer and what was the price of each item? List your answer in 
descending order of customer last name. 

SELECT	 firstname, lastname itemname, cost
FROM	 customers c, orders o, items i
WHERE	 c.customerid = o.customerid
	 AND o.itemid = i.itemid
ORDER BY lastname DESC;	

6. For people who ordered more than one item, what was the total cost of the items they ordered and 
how many items did they order? 

SELECT	 lastname, SUM(cost) AS totalcost, COUNT(quantity) AS totalitems
FROM	 customers c, orders o, items i
WHERE	 c.customerid = o.customerid
	 AND o.itemid = i.itemid
GROUP BY o.customerid
HAVING	 COUNT(quantity) > 1
ORDER BY o.customerid;

7. Write a query of your own that involves a sub-select and two tables. You need to say what question 
the query is answering, ie like the questions above, you need to submit the query and the query results.

For each order costing over £50 list the customer details and how much the order was


SELECT	firstname, lastname , sum(linecost) as totalpurchased
FROM	customers c, orders o 
WHERE	c.customerid = o.customerid
AND	itemid  in
	(SELECT itemid
	FROM orders
	WHERE linecost > 50 )
GROUP BY lastname
ORDER BY lastname
;
